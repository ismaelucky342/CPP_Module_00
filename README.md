### Description
- The "Megaphone" exercise involves creating a C++ program that takes command-line arguments and converts them to uppercase.
- If no arguments are provided, the program should print a loud and annoying feedback message.

### Objective
#### The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with:

- Handling command-line arguments.
- Converting characters to uppercase.
- Printing messages to the console.

# ex01
### Description
- The "Phonebook" exercise involves creating a C++ program to manage contact information.
- The program allows users to add new contacts and search for existing ones.
- Each contact consists of a first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and a secret.

### Objective
#### The goal of this exercise is to practice:
- Handling user input and commands.
- Managing and storing contact information.
- Implementing a simple phonebook with add and search functionalities.

# ex02
### Description
- This project implements a C++ Account class that simulates the basic behavior of a bank account. 
- The class handles fundamental operations such as deposits and withdrawals, and provides methods to get and display information about an individual account as well as global statistics about all accounts.

### The implementation includes: 
- Account Management: Allows the creation of accounts with an initial deposit and keeps track of global statistics for all accounts, such as total funds, total number of deposits, and withdrawals.
- Account Operations: Provides functionality for making deposits and withdrawals, and checking whether withdrawals are possible with the current balance.
- Information Display: Includes methods to display the status of a specific account and aggregate information about all accounts.
- Timestamp: Includes a method to display the current timestamp when performing transactions, providing the temporal context for each transaction.

### Exercise Objective 
#### The main objective of this exercise is to: 
- Implement the Account Class: Create a class that handles the basic operations of a bank account, including creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and managing global statistics.
- Display Account Information: Implement methods to display the status of each account and global statistics about all accounts.
- Manage Transaction Times: Include a function that displays the current timestamp for each transaction, helping to track when transactions are made.
- Test Functionality: Develop a main program that creates multiple accounts, performs deposits and withdrawals, and then displays account information and global statistics.


# Extras

These exercises have provided a practical and in-depth understanding of several important aspects of C++ programming. Solutions to real-world problems have been implemented, from basic string and data structure manipulation to the simulation of more complex financial transactions. Each exercise contributed to the development of key skills in program design, data management, and user interaction. The experience gained in these exercises provides a solid foundation for tackling more advanced programming challenges and developing more complex applications in C++.
