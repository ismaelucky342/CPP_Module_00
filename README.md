- If no arguments are provided, the program should print a loud and annoying feedback message.

### Objective
#### The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with:

- Handling command-line arguments.
- Converting characters to uppercase.
- Printing messages to the console.

### Description
- The "Phonebook" exercise involves creating a C++ program to manage contact information.
- The program allows users to add new contacts and search for existing ones.
- Each contact consists of a first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and a secret.

### Objective
#### The goal of this exercise is to practice:
- Handling user input and commands.

### Description
- This project implements a C++ Account class that simulates the basic behavior of a bank account. 
- The class handles fundamental operations such as deposits and withdrawals, and provides methods to get and display information about an individual account as well as global statistics about all accounts.

### The implementation includes: 
- Account Management: Allows the creation of accounts with an initial deposit and keeps track of global statistics for all accounts, such as total funds, total number of deposits, and withdrawals.
- Account Operations: Provides functionality for making deposits and withdrawals, and checking whether withdrawals are possible with the current balance.
- Information Display: Includes methods to display the status of a specific account and aggregate information about all accounts.
- Timestamp: Includes a method to display the current timestamp when performing transactions, providing the temporal context for each transaction.

### Exercise Objective 
#### The main objective of this exercise is to: 
- Implement the Account Class: Create a class that handles the basic operations of a bank account, including creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and managing global statistics.
- Display Account Information: Implement methods to display the status of each account and global statistics about all accounts.
- Manage Transaction Times: Include a function that displays the current timestamp for each transaction, helping to track when transactions are made.
- Test Functionality: Develop a main program that creates multiple accounts, performs deposits and withdrawals, and then displays account information and global statistics.
